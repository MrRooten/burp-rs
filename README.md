# burp-rs

burpsuite-like tools. Because the burp extension is hard to debug, so I write a burp-like tool

## How to use it
``git clone ${this}``  

``sudo apt install ruby``  

``cd burp-rs``  

``cargo build --release``  

``cp -r active/ target/release/``  

``cd target/release``  

``./burp-rs``
